Journal:
I had a dream about code last night. Andrew was trying to wake me up and he was pushing against my back and shaking me. In my dream, I was in the rroutes file and saw that the http request for get for the 'awake' action or something but instead i had put a 'want' action but it was crashing, and i even knew that there was not 'want' request or whatever. But I could hear Andrew say, 'wake up' but I wasn't waking up and then I woke up. It was some trippy, Matrix-y type of shit t dealing with code that didn't even really make sense. Like it was somewhat lucid... like I knew I was sleeping, but the action of "wake up" wasn't working correctly... and it manifested that way in my physical reality. Trippy af.
