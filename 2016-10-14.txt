code: looked at video that sorts table with creating link and sends param to controller that sorts based on order with param name that equals column name in table. trying to translate that to the views on the menu, that if BOTH a section and sort method (alphabetical or price, ascending and descending) then filters out the views that way.

read: looking at ways at refactoring. nil is falsey but not false. false is false. 0 is truey... in ruby. also everything in ruby is an object, thus referring to something coded in machine language (or something) so because each thing is a reference, it is potentially slower than primitive values. but you can't have a big primitive value. 

exercise: this morning went to gym. pullups, rows, tricep extensions, bicep curls.. Evening went with Andrew and we did 3 sets of burpees and pullups. Then intense circuit of incline dumbbell press, machine flies sitting up, and pushups in between. 200 abs of 20 straight leg situps, 20 crunches, 20 twists with weight, 20 leg kicking, 20 ab roll outs on wheel, twice each. i think total of 80 pushups today.
