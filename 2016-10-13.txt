code: created an order form so users can create orders and counts it next to the food item. what needs to be done is an 'order cart' that tracks and displays how many food_items are in it. also, upon clicking 'alphabetical' displaying food_items list by section and all together sorts items alphabetically... 

read: I read some of 'ruby wizardry' and did some of the exercises. created a program that colors panda's food purple. using 'include.'

exercise: shadowboxing, hip exercises, lower back stretches, 50 pushups (sore from doing pushups previous 2 days). Gonna go to the gym in about an hour and a halalf to do more and can update this entry manually. 

manual update 11:15pm: went to the gym with Andrew. Did 3 circuits of shoulder flies with dumbbells, tricep pull extensions, pull-ups, and rows. Then some shadowboxing. Was good. Need to maintain and keep it up. 

Journal:
This program runs too linearly. But it somewhat serves its purpose for me to  do all the shit I set out for myself... for example, I technically lied that I wrote left hand. Also need to add "juggle" left hand too. [pause] ...and 10 min later, I just finished writing lefthand while learning Vietnamese words and sayings.

I also juggled with my left hand upon waking. bao nhieu means how much? I believe…

Need to create more structure of finding breaks to get up and stretch core and hips. 

As well as go to gym in morning and before it closes. 

The human body is the tool to carry out the brain’s movements, thus must be maintained and kept sharp for the brain to be sharp and deploy its productions/effectuations effectively(?) Don’t know what else I’d be doing…
