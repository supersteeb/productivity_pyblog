# Bougie-ass productivity blog written in python

**productivity_pyblog** is a shitty python program that i run every day and somewhat log my productivity, thus unveiling so many holes in my coding logic and helping me learn more. 

**Goals**: What I want to do with this is create a web application that would share what I learned, thus keeping myself productive and (usefully) visually (and effectively) document my progress and organize it in a neat way (which I will eventually figure out)

Whatever the case, I'm excited!


Edit (Update: 12:44 pm):
So the chess screenshot is like evidence of the game I played (first one, I lost horribly), but then there's way to measure feedback and progress. 

Also, this becomes like a public journal... that hopefully one day the data can be parsed and imported into a better application. 

Yes, this is not an original idea... but perhaps this may work for me... if anything, it'll help me learn coding. ... or motivate me to learn more so I can do this shit more effectively.
